# Coloured-squares-game
Coloured squares game built in web development class by Colt Steele on udemy.com, in progress.

This repo holds the coloured squares guessing game built during Colt Steele's web dev course on udemy. So far it's the the exact example built in class.

####My goal
As I learn more and venture out from basic Javascript, I want to make other games or quizzes based on this gameplay.
