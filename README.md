# Coloured-squares-game
Coloured squares game built in web development class by Colt Steele on udemy.com, section 17. The game is complete now, and I've completed section 17 of the course.

This repo holds the game so I can modify if I wish as I learn more about interactive features of Javascript.

#### My goal
As I learn more and venture out from basic Javascript, I want to make other games or quizzes based on this type of gameplay.
